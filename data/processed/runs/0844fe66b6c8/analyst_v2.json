  "thesis": "Tesla (TSLA) is a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity driven by factors such as market sentiment and regulatory changes, as highlighted by preliminary evidence (E1, E2, E3). However, low confidence in the available data (E1: confidence 0.20, E2: confidence 0.20, E3: confidence 0.20) limits our ability to strongly assert claims about its business model, such as reliance on electric vehicles and energy storage growth. A balanced 6-month scenario analysis suggests potential upside from catalysts like earnings reports or product launches, but significant downside risks, including margin compression or regulatory setbacks, could amplify volatility and lead to losses, despite data gaps.",
  "bullets": [
    "Based on E2 financial data, test whether Tesla's Q3 revenue growth stabilizes above 25% compared to Q2 levels",
    "Using E2 guidance, verify if gross margins exceed 20% in Q3 to indicate potential margin expansion",
    "According to E3 peer comparisons, assess if valuation multiples (e.g., P/E) revert to industry averages of 5-10x within 6 months"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "High volatility from market sentiment shifts and regulatory uncertainty",
    "Competition from traditional automakers and new EV entrants potentially eroding Tesla's market share",
    "Margin compression from scaling production costs, as indicated by E2 data",
    "Dependency on leadership stability and potential regulatory risks from U.S. investigations",
    "Valuation risks if multiples do not revert to historical norms as per E3"
  ],
  "catalysts": [
    "Q3 earnings report showing strong EV deliveries and margin improvement based on E2",
    "Successful regulatory outcomes from EPA reviews potentially boosting Tesla's valuation via E3",
    "Positive product launches in energy storage that could drive revenue growth per E2"
