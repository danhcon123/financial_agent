    {
      "issue": "Citation inconsistency and vagueness: The thesis cites E1 as 'business overview and revenue model,' but no details are provided, making this evidence potentially weak or subjective. Additionally, multiple growth claims rely on E2 (management guidance and financial data), which may be optimistic and not independently verified, introducing confirmation bias.",
      "severity": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Overreliance on positive forward-looking guidance (E2) without acknowledging potential downward revisions or market volatility could lead to an unbalanced view. The thesis assumes continued growth based on trends, but lacks rigorous testing of assumptions against counterfactual scenarios.",
      "severity": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Risk coverage is superficial; while risks are listed, there's no depth in how they might impact the thesis or how the company is mitigating them. For instance, competition from AWS isn't quantified, and the 'balanced risk profile' is not substantiated with data on risk probabilities.",
      "severity": "MEDIUM"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Valuation-based evidence (E3) assumes a direct link between low P/E ratios and upside potential, but this may ignore fundamental growth requirements. The thesis downplays uncertainties, potentially indicating anchoring bias on historical averages.",
