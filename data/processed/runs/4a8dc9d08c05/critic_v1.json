  "assessment": "MODERATE",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "Thesis relies heavily on unspecified evidence stubs (E1, E2, E3) without detailed data, making claims potentially overconfident and unverifiable.",
      "severity": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Short-term risks of price volatility are acknowledged but not adequately integrated with the investment recommendation, lacking a clear strategy to mitigate or exploit volatility in a 6-month horizon.",
      "severity": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Risks are enumerated but not quantified or contextualized within the thesis, failing to provide a balanced view against the growth potential.",

    "Quantitative data on Tesla's historical volatility and its correlation with investment performance over similar time frames",
    "Detailed competitive analysis including market share trends and BYD's impact on Tesla's leadership",
    "Evidence linking Tesla's valuation metrics to actual financial outcomes and downside scenarios under macroeconomic stress"

  "unsupported_claims": [],
  "contradictory_evidence": [
    "Tesla's stock has experienced significant drawdowns during periods of high volatility, contradicting the thesis that short-term risks are manageable for aggressive investors",
    "BYD's rapid growth in EV market share in Asia has pressured Tesla's dominance, potentially undermining the thesis on market leadership"

  "recommended_revisions": [
    "Specify and validate the evidence for each claim (e.g., provide data sources for E1, E2, E3) to ensure robustness",
    "Incorporate a volatility risk assessment, including historical data and potential strategies to hedge or capitalize on it in a 6-month horizon",
    "Add counterfactual analysis, such as scenarios where key risks materialize (e.g., regulatory changes leading to reduced EV demand), and revise thesis accordingly"
